### A hands-on approach to bring youth on track into transit careers

Public transit agencies in North America are struggling to hire and keep full-time workers, especially as many employees near retirement. Key roles like train operators, electricians, and law enforcement are hard to fill, leading to staff shortages that disrupt schedules and limit service hours. These shortages also affect rider safety and increase the risk of delays or accidents.

In response to the lack of awareness about careers in the transportation sector — and the absence of a clear recruitment pathway — the BARTinators have developed Transiteers, an interactive video game designed to introduce young people to real-world transit careers.

To make the experience as immersive as possible, Transiteers players meet characters modeled after real BART employees. Whether it's helping lost riders as a station agent or rerouting trains during emergencies as a train controller, players gain first-hand insight into the work that keeps transit systems like BART running. Each employee serves as an in-game mentor, guiding players through fun and interactive simulations of their daily tasks.
